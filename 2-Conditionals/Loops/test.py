# Iterate 0 to 10 using for loop, do the same using while loop.

# Iterate 10 to 0 using for loop, do the same using while loop.

# Write a loop that makes seven calls to print(),
# so we get on the output the following triangle:

#No 1:
number = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
for i in number:
    print(i)
    
for i in range(11):
    print(i)
